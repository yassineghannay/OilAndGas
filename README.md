# OilAndGas
OilAndGas in python using only simple python syntax
Using 2 constants for the  raw price of the oil and gas, the program calculates the total price depending on quantity,province and tax rates respectively.
In the future, I plan add functions to this program and import some libraries that will give real time prices of real world oil and gas barrels.
Some test cases are provided!
